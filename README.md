====================

The solutions to the www.nodeschool.io tutorial series.

Note
---------
While it's okay to sneak a peak at these solutions, I implore you to come up with your own solutions to this choose-your-own-adventure type of tutorial series. I have omited any information about cloning the repo because it is not needed. Simply look at the solution you are stuck with. 

Prerequisites
-----------------------
**An installation of Node.js is all you need to learn the modules.**
  1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  2. Run `sudo npm install MODULENAMEHERE -g`
  3. Run `MODULENAMEHERE`
  4. **.. profit!**

To see the npm install commands for each modules, please visit [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/)


Organization of repo
-----------------------
As I progress through the modules of Nodeschool, I will push the files here. Each Module in this directory corresponds to that seen on the [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io) front page. 

*Organization of Challenges*

Sub-directories of each modules are the various challenges to be completed for that respective module. Each challenge of a given module has been numbered as per the lesson. I have named the *.js file program.js to stay consistant with the help text that appears during the tutorial. You may name them however you'd like. Just make the according change when verifying your solution. Inside each program.js file you will find the challenge description, my solution as well as that of the author of the series. 

Comments & concerns
-----------------------
Feel free to tweet me [@bhargavCarleton](https://twitter.com/bhargavCarleton). I will respond as soon as possible. Please do note that I am very new to this. I maynot be of much help, refer to google or #node.js community on freenode first. #node.js as well as #angularjs have helped me tremendously. They were (still are) my guides, helping me climb the great mountain that is Node.
